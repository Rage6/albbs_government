# Buckeye Boys State

<b>What is Buckeye Boys State (BBS)?</b>
<p>
  This annual summer program is an 8-day, hands-on experience in the operation of the democratic form of government, the organization of political parties, and the relationship of one to the other in shaping Ohio government. For more information, <a href="http://www.ohiobuckeyeboysstate.com/">click here</a>.
 </p>

<b>What is this website?</b>
<p>
  This is the hub of multiple "mini-websites" which will help other BBS delegates, friends, and family follow what is happening in the different branches of their government. For example, the BBS Governor and his staff will have an entire page in which they can publicize their most important activities, events, goals, and policies each day.
</p>

<b>Why is its purpose?</b>
<p>
  There are two important reasons for this website:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <span style='text-decoration:underline'>Delegate Learning</span>: Buckeye Boys State is a very large program, often exceeding 1000 delegates, so it is impossible for a single delegate to easily understanding what is happening within their new BBS government as a whole. This website will resolve some of that problem. Its <span style='color:red'>primary reason</span> is to allow delegates to quickly find a particular city, county, or state page and then learn the most up-to-date BBS information that they are searching for.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style='text-decoration:underline'>Advertisement/Understanding Among Non-Delegates</span>: The BBS program's only current, consistent means of advertising explaining itself is is by past delegates share their stories/experiences with others. This is not sufficient because, even if all of the delegates were to actively promote BBS, a single delegate cannot thoroughly explain it outside of their role as a delegate. This is why the <span style='color: blue'>secondary reason</span> of this website is to display the structure and function of BBS to non-delegates (parents, potential delegates, high school counselors, etc). This explanation can also act as an easy advertisement, with which anyone (delegate or not) can share this website rather than trying to thoroughly explain this seemingly overwhelming program.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style='text-decoration:underline'>Government Clarity</span>: As mentioned in the above "primary reason", there will be frequent updates about what has been happening within the numerous government branches of BBS. In this way, this website will serve a <span style='color:green'>third reason</span>, which is to teach the delegates in charge the importance of clear and frequent communication between the elected and their constituents. It is worth noting that these updates will be carried out by THE DELEGATES (and not the counselor staff). The things posted on their webpages (new laws, recent court cases, executive policies, etc) will be written by the delegates themselves. A counselor or Legionnaire will have to approve these posts before they will appears online, but this is mostly to prevent offensive or false posts.

  </ol>
