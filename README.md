# Buckeye Boys State

<b>What is Buckeye Boys State (BBS)?</b>
<p>
  This annual summer program is an 8-day, hands-on experience in the operation of the democratic form of government, the organization of political parties, and the relationship of one to the other in shaping Ohio government.

 </p>

<b>What is this website?</b>
<p>
  This is the hub of multiple "mini-websites" which will help other BBS delegates, friends, and family follow what is happening in the different branches of their government. For example, the BBS Governor and his staff will have an entire page in which they can publicize their most important activities, events, goals, and policies each day.
</p>

<b>Why is its purpose?</b>
<p>
  There are two important reasons for this website:
  <ol>
    <li>
      <u>Delegate Learning</u>: Buckeye Boys State is a very large program, often exceeding 1000 delegates, so it is impossible for a single delegate to easily track what is happening within their new BBS government. The <span style='color:red'>primary reason</span> for website will resolve some of that problem. Upon entering this website, they will be able to quickly find a particular city/county/state page and learn the most up-to-date information that his elected delegates have shared.
