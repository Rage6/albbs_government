        {"post_id":"1201","title":"The State of Ohio Appellant vs. Goldilocks, \r\nAppellee ","content":"{1} The case before the Ohio Supreme Court of the State of Ohio vs. Goldilocks is in front of the court due to an appeal on behalf of the state based on the thirteenth districts court of appeals ruling which found that the defendant, Goldilocks, was not guilty of the accused crime R.C&gt; 2911.12(A)(3).\r\n {2} The facts of the case are as follows: The defendant came across a building in the woods while hiking. Before the occupants left, one of them placed a large bowl of porridge on the open windowsill, which the defendant sampled upon smelling it. The defendant then decided to make her presence known at the entrance of the structure knocking on the door. Upon not hearing any occupants respond, she entered the structure with the intention of consuming the structures porridge and resting in the abode. The defendant claimed she felt a sense of welcome and believed that the structures intent was to serve hikers with hospitality. After entering the structure, she consumed the porridge and took a nap in the occupants guest room. During her time in the structure, she damaged the occupant&rsquo;s chair, prompting her to write an apology letter for the incident. They found their kitchen in a mess and they found their chair destroyed. Occupants of the structure proceeded to press charges against the defendant.\r\n \t{3} The standard for the review in front of the court is that of the criminal and willful trespass upon an occupied structure as identified in R.C. 2911.211 and R.C. 2909.01 respectively. \r\n{4} The facts within the case establish that the defendant first entered into an occupied structure as established by R.C. 2909.01 when the defendant tried the porridge with a ladle through the open window. However, the defendant did not meet the definition of trespassing as defined under R.C. 2911.21 (A) as the defendant did not knowingly enter into another person&rsquo;s premises. They thought that it was merely a rest stop for hikers. While the defendant did use force to enter the house when entering through the door, there was no intent or purpose to commit any criminal offenses-additionally, the court finds that the defendant did not commit criminal or regular trespassing in violation of state law. This is because the court could not determine if the defendant committed the entry with intent to commit a crime or not. This is a stipulation that must be met in order to find a defendant guilty of said crimes.\r\n\t{5} The court thus finds the defendant not guilty of the charged crimes.\r\n\r\n","post_order":"1","chamber_prefix":null,"approved":"1","timestamp":"2022-06-16 11:58:32","subtype_id":"8","type_id":"6","section_id":"4"},

The Governor's red book however does not include any such obligation. The State Board of Education brought notification before the Governor on three separate occasions by three different means. The means were as follows; in person, via phone call, and via text message. The governor refused to make the appointments. The State Board of Education requests a writ of mandamus requiring the Governor to make the appointments. \r\n\t{&para; 3} The red book is treated as binding law in Buckeye Boys State. However under the Ohio and U.S. Constitution, no law is enforceable to a party who is not under notice of the law.\r\n{&para; 4} Thus the Court finds that obligations of one public office contained in the red book of another public office are enforceable once notice is provided of that obligation. \r\n{&para; 5} THEREFORE, because the Governor was put on notice of his obligations under the State Board of Education&rsquo;s red book, the court finds that the Governor is under an obligation to comply with those rules. Thus the Governor is hereby ORDERED to make the three State Board of Education appointments.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED\r\nSigned: Chief Justice Miller, Justice Smialek, Justice Moloney II, Justice Mullins, Justice Moore\r\nDissent\r\nEICHER, J.\r\n{&para; 1} In the case of State ex rel. State Board of Education V. The Office of the Governor of Buckeye Boys State, the majority opinion, which sided with the State of Ohio, is wrong. Given the definition of Mandamus&ndash;as found in R.C. 2731.01&ndash; &ldquo;Mandamus is a writ, issued in the name of the state to an inferior tribunal, a corporation, board, or person, commanding the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station.&rdquo; This opinion holds that the Relator must show that the Office of the Governor failed in their duty to act, which the Relator has not done.\r\n{&para; 2} The law which the State is attempting to enforce against the Office of the Governor is found in Section 3301.01 (A) of the Ohio Revised Code, which read in part: &ldquo;There is hereby created the state board of education consisting of nineteen members&hellip;, and with eight members to be appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the senate.&rdquo; This statute does require the governor to appoint members to the State Board of Education, but it does not set any time frame by which the action must be taken. If the Revised Code does not set forth a time by which the Governor is to have completed the action, nor if the legislature or judiciary has mandated a time, then the decision of when to make the action is up to the Office of the Governor. Since the Governor is within his rights to choose when to appoint the members of the State Board of Education, the rights of the State Board of Education have not been infringed upon. Not finding any rights which the Governor has infringed, I believe that this Mandamus suit was frivolous..\r\n{&para;3} For these reasons, we dissent.\r\n\r\nDissent:\r\nJustice Eicher\r\n","post_order":"1","chamber_prefix":null,"approved":"1","timestamp":"2022-06-18 11:19:41","subtype_id":"9","type_id":"6","section_id":"4"},

Jones\r\n                 June 18, 2022","content":"         APPELLANT: BUCKEYE BOYS STATE,\r\n                        V.\r\n                 APPELLEE: JONES.\r\n[Cite as Buckeye Boys State v. Jones, 1 BBS 01 (2022)]\r\n              Case argued June 17, 2022\r\n       by Attorney Schmiesing for Appellant \r\n       and Attorney Peters for the Appellee\r\n----------------------------------------------  \r\nSYLLABUS OF THE COURT\r\n\tBuckeye Boys State is a single continuous state that resumes activities every year after recess, as opposed to an autonomous government that is reformed every year. Thus, citizens of Buckeye State are citizens for life and endowed with all of the rights entailed by Buckeye Boys State citizenship\r\n----------------------------------------------  \r\nMullins, D.\r\n{1} This matter is before the Court on the appeal of Buckeye Boys State to the decision of the Court of Appeals, Wagonseller County. Appellant requests that this Court overturn the decision of the Court of Appeals issued in this matter on June 17, 2022. The decision made by the Court of Appeals stated that licensed attorneys of previous Buckeye Boys State years may not practice law after graduation because the state of Buckeye Boys State is dissolved before the creation of a brand new state of Buckeye Boys State every year, making each State a new autonomous government.\r\n{2} The facts of the case are as follows: a defendant was issued a citation of speeding which allegedly violated the Buckeye Boys State Traffic Code. A trial was set for 9:30 a.m. June 17, 2022. When that time arrived, no prosecuting attorney was present to represent the state in the case. Mr. Kemerer &ndash; who was a citizen of Buckeye Boys State and Passed the Bar Exam in 1998 &ndash; was present as an Advisor for the court. Seeing the lack of a prosecuting attorney, he stepped forward and represented him State in the trial. The Defendant asked the Trial Court Judge to dismiss the case as the Prosecuting Attorney had not passed the 2022 Buckeye Boys State Bar Exam. The Judge dismissed the case on that basis. The State appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals, which upheld the Trial Court&rsquo;s decision 2-1. The State then appealed to this Court.\r\n{3} There is no rule or law on point, thus the court looks to the spirit of the Ohio Constitution and the Buckeye Boys State Gold Book. The Constitution that we are operating under is dated back to 2017 and there is no rule that requires Buckeye Boys State attorneys to resign or renew their license. It is the duty of sectional advisors to help and educate the Buckeye Boys State residents on how to perform their duties. See: Buckeye Boys State- THE GOLD BOOK Delegate Handbook, 2022, at 11. This is what the sectional advisor was doing by filling in. Furthermore, The Buckeye Boy State Golden Book says &ldquo;The goal of Buckeye Boys State is to educate and train you in understanding one of this country&rsquo;s most precious freedoms; the democratic form of government. It is hoped you will use the knowledge gained to take an active role in not only Buckeye Boys State, but society as well.&rdquo; The court finds that since the state budget for 2022 was set by the 2021 Boys State Office of Budget and Management, there are clear functions which are affected from one year to the next. Finally, the Supreme Court of Buckeye State is the sole regulator of the legal profession of Buckeye Boys State thus the court has the authority to make the designation to allow previous Boys State licenses to practice in our Buckeye Boys State.\r\n{4} This court hereby finds that Buckeye Boys State is a single continuous state that resumes every summer after fifty- one week recess as opposed to a new autonomous government. Thus a law license granted by Buckeye Boys State in 1998 is effective for practice in any subsequent Buckeye Boys State Government. Once you are a citizen of Buckeye Boys State, you are a citizen for life.\r\n{5} THEREFORE, The Court hereby overrules the decision of the appellate and trial court and remanded the matter to the trial court for further proceedings based upon our decision. This remand will allow for the original matter over the traffic violation to be decided. \r\nIt is so ordered. \r\nSigned: Justice Mullins, Justice Eichner, Justice Miller, Justice Smialek, Justice Moloney\t\r\nConcurring Opinion of Chief Justice Miller\r\n\tI concur with the conclusion of the majority. However, I would add that the Ohio Constitution and the United States Constitution require representation of all parties charged with crimes. Thus I would add that the Buckeye Boys State should allow previously licensed lawyers to practice in order to ensure compliance with the Ohio and U.S. Constitution. Without the precedent set here today the Constitutional right to a fair and speedy trial could be undermined.\r\n\r\nDissenting Opinion\r\nHIGGINS, M.\r\n{1} In the case of Jones V. The State of Ohio, the majority opinion which sided with the State of Ohio, is wrong because it enables Counselors and Alumni to serve in positions which are not by right or responsibility their own. Additionally, the court&rsquo;s understanding of the expectations of the Bar Association in terms of length of service is fundamentally flawed as it assumes an untenable length of time and provides unlimited access to legal practice regardless of current eligibility,\r\n\r\n            {2} First, the majority opinion is flawed because it provides Buckeye Boys State (BBS) Alumni the ability to assume responsibilities that are not their own when times of crisis make these assumptions necessary. This provision would enable alumni to assume any and all responsibility simply by declaring a time of crisis. As there is no clarification provided in the BBS Blue Book (The Ohio Government Digest), the Gold Book of BBS has supreme determination in this case. The Gold Book on Page 34 Paragraph 7 states,\r\n\r\n&ldquo;As with all other aspects of Buckeye Boys State, young men participating in the Law\/Court system learn by doing and gain practical knowledge in Ohio law which can benefit them in college, especially those planning to be lawyers.&rdquo;\r\n&lsquo;Young men&rsquo; here refers to the delegates of BBS, as according to the previous passage in the Gold book (page 1 paragraph 4) which states, &ldquo;&hellip;Young men&hellip;who may be selected to attend Buckeye Boys State&hellip;&rdquo; &lsquo;Learn by doing&rsquo; here refers to the process of actual practice. As no delegate was available to prosecute the defendant, the case was and ought to have been thrown out three courts ago. Instead, it made its way to the Supreme Court, where it was decided that the case should be heard as it would have a state-wide effect. And while The Gold Book is not a statute, there is no overriding statute without Blue Book evidence. The effect of this precedent is now to provide counselors with more power, not less. The majority opinion now allows counselors who have previously passed the required tests and training to practice law, regardless of time spent away from the program. However, this precedent can be construed to any position within the BBS government, regardless of power. For instance, fifty-year removed alumni might hand out tickets, having once served in the highway patrol. This would be neither fair nor practical and would quickly lead to any number of unrealistic lawsuits and accusations without any real way of resolving them.\r\n\r\n            {3} additionally, the very citizenship of the BBs alumni is open to interpretation and therefore should not be the center of legal questions. In the first degree, the Gold Book, Page 22, Paragraph 1 states, &ldquo;YOU, as a Buckeye Boys State Citizen MUST obtain some form of employment.&rdquo; The question of citizenship is therefore raised. Citizenship might be determined by employment, however, employment might also be determined by citizenship. Regardless of perspective, it is clear that citizenship in the program is not clearly outlined, and the limitations on it in terms of length and youth are neither present nor specified. For this lack of clarity, it might be suggested that the counselor who served as prosecuting attorney was not a BBS citizen at the time, regardless of prior citizenship. Additionally while the given counselor did pass the bar exam, it was approximately 24 years ago and therefore ought to be held in suspension barring further determination.\r\n\r\n            For these reasons, we dissent.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDissent:\r\n\r\nJustice Higgins, Justice Moore\r\n\r\n","post_order":"1","chamber_prefix":null,"approved":"1","timestamp":"2022-06-18 11:23:28","subtype_id":"9","type_id":"6","section_id":"4"},

This is clear because an audio recording was upheld as admissible evidence due to the fact that the Deputy Attorney General can lie about the privacy of a matter since he is a law enforcement officer. \r\n______________________________\r\n\tMOLONEY II, M.\r\n{&para; 1} This matter is before the Court on the emergency appeal granted by the Ohio Supreme Court requested by Ibe &amp; Jones. They request the decision of The Common Pleas Court be overturned due to the allowance of an audio recording as evidence.\r\n{&para; 2} The facts of the case are as follows: Ibe and Jones agree to embezzle $500,000 from the lottery commission. They forge checks from the lottery commission. The Deputy Attorney General is tipped off about the embezzlement and decides to bring Ibe and Jones in for questioning in the hopes of receiving a confession. The Deputy Attorney General promises that their discussion will remain a private matter however he records the oral conversation on his smartphone. Ibe and Jones then go to the State Bank to deposit the checks but are unable to do so as the bank rips up the checks after they learn they are acts of forgery. Due to this series of events, Ibe and Jones did not commit Embezzlement but rather committed Conspiracy to Embezzlement. The office of the Attorney General then decides to sue them each for $20,000 in a civil case due to the hardship they caused by attempting to embezzle. The Court of Common Pleas rules that the main piece of evidence is admissible and grants the suit of the Attorney General.\r\n{&para; 3} It is known by this court that legal law enforcement officers can lie to suspects of a crime in order to obtain information relevant to the crime.\r\n{&para; 4} Thus the Court finds that the audio recording evidence is admissible in court because it was obtained through deception by a legal law enforcement officer. This means that the confession to embezzlement is admissible and upheld by the court. The intentions of Ibe &amp; Jones become clear due to their desire to commit embezzlement and subsequent committal of Conspiracy to embezzle. However, since Ibe &amp; Jones did not commit embezzlement but rather ended up committing Conspiracy to Embezzlement the lawsuit of the Attorney General is permitted.\r\n{&para; 5} THEREFORE, this court orders that the request of the lawsuit by the Attorney General be upheld and that Ibe &amp; Jones each fulfill their requests. This means Ibe &amp; Jones must each pay $20,000 for their committal of conspiracy to embezzlement and for the hardships they cost the Office of The Attorney General. \r\nIT IS SO ORDERED\r\nSigned: Justice Moloney II, Chief Justice Miller, Justice Smialek, Justice Higgins, Justice Mullins, Justice Moore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","post_order":"1","chamber_prefix":null,"approved":"1","timestamp":"2022-06-18 12:07:04","subtype_id":"9","type_id":"6","section_id":"4"}
